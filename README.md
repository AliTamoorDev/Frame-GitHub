This repository provides an iOS app with dynamic data storage, drawing capabilities, and an advanced dynamic form creation feature. Users can draw directly in a text field-like area (similar to drawing on an iPad), while also being able to create forms within forms. The app supports nested forms where you can create a form inside another form and navigate between them seamlessly on new screens.
